# Exercise 1
from math import pi
def get_area_of_circle(radius):
    return pi*radius*radius
# Done in 50 sec

# Additional questions:
# Do we need to consider the case where the radius is not a float/int ?

# AK: I think we should, indeed. Moreover, it is really interesting where the radius comes from

# Exercise 2
import os
def find_postcode_lines_in_files_in_dir(path, postcodes=[]):
    """
    This function will return a list of tuples : (file_path, line)
    if the line contains a postcode from the postcodes
    """
    save_lists = []
    for current_file in os.listdir(path):
        current_path = os.path.join(path, current_file)
        if os.path.isdir(current_path):
            save_lists = save_lists + find_postcode_lines_in_files_in_dir(current_path)
        elif os.path.isfile(current_path):
            f = open(current_path)
            for line in f:
                for postcode in postcodes:
                    if postcode in line:
                        save_lists.append( (current_path, line))
            f.close()
    return save_list
# Done in 23 min

# Additional questions:
# 1. How should we consider postcodes ?
# --> I belive the runtime can be optimized if we have more knowledge of what a postcode look like e.g. string of int of special size

# AK: the regular Dutch postcode looks like XX 0000. How would that modify code?

# 2. Do we want to reduce the search to only certain type e.g. .txt or .csv ?
# --> I did a recursion algo to look at all files in all folders.

# AK: I would suggest all files, which is nice.

# 3. What exactly do we want the function to return ?
# --> I returned a tuple with the path and the line so we can easily look at the whole file for any reason

# AK: that totally serves the purpose. 

# Exercise 3
def sum_of_list(L):
    c = 0
    for i in L:
        c += i
    return c
# Done in 30 sec

# Additional questions:
# How should we consider the case where the list elements are not numbers ? 

# AK: It is very important - how would you validate for that?


# AK: letâ€™s split the files into executable py files if possible :)
